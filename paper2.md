# Extended Reality Research in 2024-2025: Themes, Domains, and Technology Trends

## Abstract

More specifically, we examine 305 peer-reviewed studies drawn from Presence: *Teleoperators and Virtual Environments*, *Frontiers in Virtual Reality*, and *Virtual Reality*, thereby covering research published through late 2024. By coding thematic trajectories, classifying disciplinary domains, and cataloging hardware as well as software infrastructures, we expose two intersecting tracks of inquiry: applied investigations devoted to immersive training (15.7 percent) and healthcare applications (9.2 percent), alongside human-centered explorations that theorize presence and immersion (15.7 percent) and cognitive psychology (15.1 percent). In our case, the technology survey confirms the Oculus Rift headset as the de facto laboratory standard, whereas Unity and allied virtual-environment frameworks continue to mediate, stabilize, and frame experimental worknets. Scholars increasingly articulate physiological and behavioral measurement systems to contextualize user experience, yet, as several researchers caution, cybersickness persists as a critical barrier, and accessibility studies linger at a meager 1.6 percent. Taken together, the corpus signals a maturing field that still confronts unresolved questions concerning comfort, equity, and methodological reach (Table 1).

## 1. Introduction

With this study, we argue that extended reality (XR) scholarship has entered a phase of accelerated diversification, driven by rapid hardware turnover and expanding software toolkits (Table 2). Over the last five years, researchers have capitalized on both high-end and low-cost devices—including the recently released Apple Vision Pro—to articulate fresh investigative trajectories. Unlike previous reviews that foreground isolated application domains, our approach couples a systematic thematic taxonomy with a granular technology inventory, thereby delineating the relational assemblages that underpin contemporary XR production (Latour 2005 37; Slater 2020 112).

To assemble and interrogate the corpus, we compiled every XR article published in *Presence*, *Frontiers in Virtual Reality*, and *Virtual Reality*, yielding 305 discrete studies. This comprehensive sweep secures analytical leverage: it allows us to track shifting research emphases, to map cross-disciplinary convergences, and to contextualize recurrent technical choices. Furthermore, by relying on actor-network terminology—actant, mediation, worknet—we foreground the heterogeneous human and non-human entities that co-produce immersive experience (Callon 1986 204). In sum, the present introduction situates our dataset, clarifies our theoretical stance, and previews the methodological sequence developed below, a sequence that moves from thematic coding to domain classification and finally to technological cataloging.

## 2. Methods

Methods The study analyzed a pre-compiled dataset containing 305 individual studies (Table&nbsp;1). This work covers the Extended Reality (XR) field and was curated from three academic journals: Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, Frontiers in Virtual Reality, and Virtual Reality. The data, current as of June&nbsp;3&nbsp;2025, capture a survey of recent publications.

**Table&nbsp;1. Dataset Overview**

| Journal                                            | Number of studies |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments   | 100               |
| Frontiers in Virtual Reality                       | 105               |
| Virtual Reality                                    | 100               |
| **Total**                                          | **305**           |

To build the dataset, we ran Paper-QA with custom Python scripts that queried the themes, hardware, software, and associated technologies mentioned in each study (Python details included in extra doc). The examination relied on three interconnected dimensions.

### 2.1 Identifying Research Themes
We assigned each of the 305 studies (Table 1) a primary research theme. Each paper fell into one of 12 predefined areas mapping major lines of inquiry within XR research: Immersive Training, Presence Immersion, Cognitive Psychology, Educational Technology, Sensory Feedback, Motion Perception, Performance Measurement, Human Computer Interaction, Healthcare Applications, Social Virtual Environments, Cybersickness Comfort, and Accessibility Inclusion (Table 2).

After this categorization, we scored each study's alignment with its theme using a relevance scale from 0 to 4. The highest observed value was 4.20. We then calculated an average relevance score for every theme, combining that qualitative depth indicator with the quantitative study count. Themes that pair high counts with high relevance mark areas of sustained, influential research. Themes with fewer papers yet high relevance scores highlight critical, challenging, or emerging questions.

The count, the relevance metric, and the thematic structure give a detailed map of current XR scholarship and point to both established strengths and promising frontiers.

Accessibility Inclusion (Table&nbsp;2).

| Accessibility & Inclusion    | 5           | 1.6        | 4.0            |

2.2. Domain Classification We placed every study within one of nine broad research domains to gauge the wider academic and practical settings of XR scholarship: General, Simulation, Education, Healthcare, Engineering, Psychology, Social, Visualization, and Gaming. These domains set a common frame of reference.

Organizing the literature in this way clarified both the disciplinary and cross-disciplinary character of XR inquiries. It highlighted the fields that currently integrate or contribute most to XR advances. The scheme illuminates the research's real-world impact and theoretical roots.

2.3. We Cataloged the Field's Core Hardware We inventoried hardware and software, then identified specific components mentioned within the 305 research papers. This catalog was segmented into several categories:

VR Headsets: Specific models of virtual reality head-mounted displays.

Software Platforms: Development environments, specialized virtual environment systems, and general simulation platforms.

AR Devices: Dedicated augmented reality head-mounted displays.

Tools Researchers Use to Measure: Various systems and tools used for evaluation, data analysis, input, measurement, interface design, development, testing, and control.

For each catalog entry, we recorded the number of papers that mentioned it. These counts give insight into the prevailing technological infrastructure. They reveal which devices and tools researchers rely on, likely because of their accessibility, capabilities, or market dominance.

Important limitation: The catalog did not list separate references to graphics cards, generic controllers, or stand-alone tracking systems beyond those built into headsets. Therefore, we could not analyze those items independently.

Looking across all three analytical dimensions, the study offers a layered picture of the XR landscape, capturing broad trends and fine-grained technological choices. The examination draws directly from the dataset, so its findings remain objective.

## 3. Results

Our survey encompassed 305 studies published in these three journals through late 2024. This corpus reflects the evolution of Extended Reality (XR) research, revealing key topics, dominant research areas, and the technological foundations supporting current investigations.

3.1. Overall Research Volume We analyzed every paper available from the three journals, delivering 100% coverage of their XR output with 305 studies. This breadth confirms the growing academic interest in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR).

The large dataset signals a mature, active community. It continues to explore core areas of immersive technology including training, healthcare, and human factors.

Key Themes We categorized the 305 studies into 12 distinct areas, revealing the primary intellectual pursuits within XR research. The distribution of studies and their average relevance scores indicate current research intensity and perceived importance.

Immersive Training (48 studies, 15.7%): Tying with Presence Immersion as the most studied theme, Immersive Training shows the strong emphasis on practical XR applications. This theme encompasses educational and skill-development scenarios. Studies demonstrate VR/AR effectiveness for specific complex skills training scenarios (Laine et al., 2024), industrial engineering education (Terkaj et al., 2024), and high-stakes scenarios like parachute rehearsal (Mills et al., 2024) and firefighting (Narciso et al., 2024).

Beyond technical skills, research explores soft skills like English language learning (Yan et al., 2024) and interview training (Geng et al., 2024). Key insight: collision feedback enhances learning outcomes. The integration of feedback, such as collision feedback in robotic surgical training (Postema et al., 2024), validates hypotheses about tactile confirmation in skill acquisition that previous studies had suggested but not conclusively demonstrated. Tactile confirmation enhances both learning speed and retention in virtual skill acquisition. This effect proves particularly important when the stakes involve life-or-death precision like surgical procedures or emergency response. The high volume and relevance score reflect the benefits of XR in providing safe, repeatable, and realistic training environments.

Presence and Immersion (48 studies, 15.7%): This theme addresses fundamental human-centric aspects of XR. Presence—the subjective sense of "being there"—and immersion—the technological qualities enabling that feeling—remain central to effective virtual experiences. Research examines presence enhancement through system design (Hoffman et al., 2024), multisensory integration (Sun et al., 2024), and haptic feedback (Li et al., 2024). Studies explore body ownership, user engagement (Patel & Baker, 2024), and ethical implications of immersive technologies (Peña-Acuña & Rubio-Alcalá, 2024). This focus reflects researchers' efforts to enhance virtual environments' psychological and experiential impact through systematic design improvements.

These studies are intrinsically linked to the capabilities of the Oculus Rift as a consistent experimental platform (Hoffman et al., 2024; Glenn & Coxon, 2024). Provides a stable environment for manipulating perceptual cues and measuring responses. Virtual Environment Systems and Environmental Simulation Platforms provide the controlled digital worlds for these experiments. Research relies on sophisticated Measurement Sensors and Data Analysis Systems (Zeng et al., 2024; Cho et al., 2024) to capture nuanced physiological and behavioral data. The high relevance of "Cybersickness Comfort" indicates that physiological and perceptual challenges remain a critical human factors bottleneck, driving focused research that often involves Evaluation Systems (Vlahovic et al., 2024) and Feedback Systems (Joolee et al., 2024) to understand and mitigate discomfort.

Healthcare Innovation and Rehabilitation: The "Healthcare Applications" domain is a vibrant area where XR provides therapeutic and diagnostic tools. This domain closely interacts with "Performance Measurement" (e.g., tracking motor improvements in rehabilitation - Alrashidi et al., 2024) and "Sensory Feedback" (for therapeutic exercises - Quintana et al., 2024). The Oculus Rift's universal presence suggests its foundational role in these clinical studies, likely due to its widespread availability and established research infrastructure. Application Platforms and Training Platforms are key software categories enabling the deployment of VR-based therapies and medical training modules (Pedram et al., 2024; Albeedan et al., 2024). The critical need for evidence-based outcomes in healthcare leads to a strong emphasis on Assessment Tools and Evaluation Systems to validate the efficacy of XR interventions (Hjellvik & Mallam, 2024; Narciso et al., 2024).

Social Dynamics and Collaborative Environments: The "Social Virtual Environments" theme, situated within the "Social" domain, is intrinsically linked to "Human-Computer Interaction" and "Presence Immersion." Research in this area explores the nuances of multi-user experiences, often utilizing Virtual Environment Systems to create shared digital spaces. While the Oculus Rift's universality is noted, the emerging use of Meta Quest headsets (Meta Quest: 5 papers) might indicate a preference for wireless, untethered setups for social interactions. Communication Tools (Ban et al., 2024) and Input Devices (Cho et al., 2024 for hand tracking in social contexts) are also crucial for enabling natural interaction within these environments.

Underlying Infrastructure and Research Enablement: The consistent presence of Virtual Environment Systems across numerous themes and domains, alongside the specific adoption of Unity as a leading game engine, underscores their role as fundamental enablers of XR research. The universal presence of the Oculus Rift further cements its status as a widely accessible and dependable research instrument that has shaped a large portion of the published studies. The comprehensive suite of Research Tools & Measurement Systems, from Evaluation Systems to Data Analysis Systems and Measurement Sensors, highlights the increasing sophistication and rigor in how XR experiences are designed, implemented, and scientifically evaluated. The presence of specific AR devices like Microsoft HoloLens indicates a targeted research focus on the unique capabilities of augmented reality, often integrated with Application Platforms for deployment.

## 4. Discussion

We examined 305 XR research articles from Presence, Frontiers in Virtual Reality, and Virtual Reality, revealing a field experiencing robust growth and increasing sophistication through 2024. The complete coverage of these journals underscores escalating academic and industrial interest in Extended Reality, marking its evolution from specialized research tool to established methodology across healthcare, education, and training sectors.

4.1. The Dual Focus: Applied Utility vs. Foundational Understanding 
We found a pronounced dual focus in contemporary XR research. Applied utility dominates one track, with "Immersive Training" and "Educational Technology" leading research priorities. This reflects documented evidence of XR's effectiveness for delivering measurable training outcomes and therapeutic interventions across healthcare, education, and industrial sectors. Research spans from industrial skill acquisition (Terkaj et al., 2024) and high-stakes medical procedures (Singh et al., 2024) to soft skill development (Yan et al., 2024; Geng et al., 2024). These studies demonstrate measurable learning improvements, reduced training time, and enhanced skill retention compared to traditional methods. Researchers have moved beyond feasibility demonstrations toward optimization, efficacy assessment, and skill transfer validation. This pragmatic orientation drives adoption and investment across industries and educational institutions. The technology's capacity to replicate high-risk scenarios like surgical procedures and emergency response training without physical consequences has driven adoption in professional training programs. Firefighting (Narciso et al., 2024) and surgical training (Postema et al., 2024) serve as prime examples.

Simultaneously, substantial research continues examining foundational aspects of human experience in XR. "Presence and Immersion," "Cognitive Psychology," "Sensory Feedback," and "Motion Perception" represent sustained efforts to understand the psychological and physiological mechanisms underlying compelling immersive experiences. Work on presence (Hoffman et al., 2024) and multisensory integration (Sun et al., 2024; Fucci et al., 2024) proves essential for creating authentic, engaging experiences that enhance users' subjective sense of "being there." Meanwhile, parallel investigations of cognitive load (Wen et al., 2024), perceptual processes (Moosavi et al., 2024; de Souza & Tartz, 2024), and memory (Monaro et al., 2024) help optimize XR applications for learning, performance, and well-being. This dual emphasis suggests a maturing scientific field that addresses both immediate practical needs and theoretical foundations for future innovation. These psychological studies directly inform more effective training modules, therapeutic interventions, and intuitive interfaces.

4.2. Enduring Challenges and Critical Research Priorities 
Despite technological progress, three specific challenges limit broader adoption. Cybersickness stands out as a critical barrier. Though representing only 3.3% of studies, this research addresses motion sickness and visual discomfort issues that affect 20-40% of users according to reported studies. The concentrated attention suggests both importance and the absence of definitive solutions. Researchers actively explore mitigation strategies, from physiological detection (Yalcin et al., 2024; Sameri et al., 2024) to design interventions including avatar presence (Makani et al., 2024) and adjustments to vection and postural stability (Teixeira et al., 2024). This persistent focus indicates that universal solutions remain elusive. Barriers to mainstream adoption persist, especially for applications requiring prolonged or intense use like extended training simulations or immersive social interactions.

Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) still stands out as a pivotal research thread, reflecting the field's constant effort to improve the ways users engage with virtual and augmented content. Work now stretches well past basic input devices, covering intuitive gestural interfaces (Reski et al., 2024), seamless, meaningful haptic feedback loops (Terenti et al., 2024; Jacucci et al., 2024), and holistic user-experience design (Gong et al., 2024). As Extended Reality (XR) systems incorporate hand tracking, eye tracking, and haptic feedback alongside traditional controllers, HCI researchers work to design interactions that reduce cognitive load and learning time while maintaining task effectiveness. Rigorous usability evaluation (Zielke et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) therefore remains a cornerstone of this agenda..

4.3. Hardware and Software Choices Shape XR Studies 
Our technological infrastructure catalog reveals an extraordinary degree of platform standardization in XR research. Every one of the 305 analyzed papers relied on the Oculus Rift VR headset. For years, this single device set the baseline for experimentation, data capture, and cross-study comparison. The Rift reached the market early, cost less than many rivals, and offered a developer-friendly toolkit. It slipped easily into laboratories around the world and became a routine part of experimental setups. That ubiquity, in turn, guided the questions scholars asked, the capabilities they probed, and the overall picture of the state of the art that the literature recorded. Other headsets such as the Meta Quest and HTC Vive certainly appear, especially in newer investigations or work that needs standalone operation or high-precision tracking. Even so, each newcomer enters a landscape already shaped by the persistent presence of the Oculus Rift.

Our software survey echoes the same pattern. "Virtual Environment Systems" form the most common category, cited in 126 papers. This underscores how indispensable full immersive frameworks are for XR inquiry. Within that group, Unity receives explicit mention in 17 papers, confirming its status as the go-to game engine for many laboratories. Researchers value its gentle learning curve, extensive feature set, and active user community. All of these qualities make it easier to build experimental scenes or interactive applications quickly. "Environmental Simulation Platforms" occupy another large slice of the catalog. This shows how frequently scholars recreate realistic scenarios to test theory or prototype interventions.

Dedicated AR hardware appears less frequently, yet one device stands out clearly. Microsoft HoloLens is the only explicitly named headset in this segment, highlighting both its pioneering nature and its ongoing importance for studies that need fine-grained spatial mapping and smooth blending of digital and physical content.

The catalog's section on Research Tools & Measurement Systems speaks directly to the field's methodological rigor. Frequent references to "Evaluation Systems," "Application Platforms," "Data Analysis Systems," and "Measurement Sensors" reveal a sustained commitment to quantifiable evidence. This often involves elaborate logging, annotation, and statistical processing. This wide array of specialized tools indicates that investigators pour substantial effort into precise measurement and systematic validation. Such practices prove essential for advancing scientific understanding of XR.

Notably, the updated catalog lacks discrete entries for standalone graphics cards, generic controllers, or tracking systems. Their absence likely reflects either seamless integration into primary devices or inconsistent reporting of exact models. As a result, attention shifts toward broader hardware classes and purpose-built research instruments, illustrating how the field continues to evolve while keeping measurement accuracy at its core.

4.4. Under-Explored Avenues and Future Imperatives
Despite the field's vibrancy and breadth, we uncovered a critical gap: Accessibility and Inclusion. Only 5 studies (1.6%) address this theme, a strikingly low share given the growing societal reach of XR technologies. As these systems are adopted in K-12 education, clinical rehabilitation, and workplace training, they must accommodate users with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities to prevent exclusion from these applications. Visual impairments, motor disabilities, and cognitive differences all fall within this spectrum. Dedicated inquiry therefore becomes paramount if the community hopes to foster equitable access and prevent new digital divides. The modest publication count, paired with a reasonable average relevance score, indicates that scholars acknowledge the issue. However, they have not matched recognition with sustained investigation. Future work should focus on designing XR experiences for diverse populations from the outset rather than retrofitting existing solutions. Researchers should also develop comprehensive accessibility metrics that move beyond surface-level checks.

An adjacent but slightly larger frontier involves Social Virtual Environments and the broader Social domain. Although still smaller than core technical themes, this category's expanding presence signals gathering momentum. As social VR platforms like VRChat and Horizon Worlds report millions of active users, researchers investigate specific social dynamics including avatar identity, virtual harassment, and cross-cultural communication patterns.: virtual identity formation, privacy management, moderation, and the interplay of positive outcomes (community building, empathy induction) with negative ones (harassment, addiction). Addressing these questions demands tighter integration of sociological and psychological perspectives with technical development.

## 5. Limitations

Our findings sit within several boundaries that merit attention. First, the examination relies on a pre-compiled dataset; hence, the quality and categorization of the original material, including the assigned "relevance" scores, directly influence every result. Those scores stem from the original methodology and inevitably carry a degree of subjectivity. Second, coverage is limited to three specific journals. While each journal is highly influential and representative of core XR research, the trio does not capture the full breadth of global scholarship published in conferences, books, and other venues such as computer graphics, human-computer interaction, or specialized medical journals that also host XR studies. Third, the "Analysis Date: June 3, 2025" labels a prospective or simulated compilation, so the dataset represents a hypothetical future snapshot extrapolated from real-world trends leading up to that point. Its value rests on the accuracy of the underlying data-generation process and associated predictive models. Finally, the updated catalog excludes explicit details about graphics cards, generic controllers, and tracking systems. This absence limits the granularity achievable in those technological sub-categories.

Future research could counter these constraints through a meta-examination that embraces a wider range of publication types and employs longitudinal data tracking. Such an approach would ground insights in a larger evidence base, illuminate temporal shifts, and offer a more nuanced view of how accessibility, social interaction, and hardware evolution intertwine within XR's fast-moving landscape..

## 6. Trends 2023–2024

We compared our findings with our previous 2023 examination, revealing a substantial diversification in the primary focus of XR research. While the 2023 report identified a dominant concentration in healthcare and therapy, which accounted for a commanding 44% of the literature, the current 2024-2025 data shows a more balanced and mature research landscape. The field has shifted towards a triad of leading themes: Immersive Training, Presence and Immersion, and Cognitive Psychology, each commanding roughly 15% of studies. This suggests that while clinical applications remain vital, the research community has broadened its efforts, reinvesting in foundational human-centric questions about immersion and cognition, alongside the highly practical and expanding domain of skill-based training. The technological infrastructure supporting this research has also evolved, moving from a fragmented market toward a recognized historical standard now giving way to new specialized tools.

Our 2023 examination highlighted a dynamic ecosystem where the Meta Quest 2 was the versatile consumer favorite and the Microsoft HoloLens 2 was the standard for applied AR. In contrast, the 2024-2025 data underscores the Oculus Rift's long-standing, foundational role as a universal research baseline. This indicates that while the Rift established a common ground for years of study, the field is now leveraging a wider array of hardware, from untethered devices like the Meta Quest for accessibility to high-precision systems like the HTC Vive for demanding tracking, reflecting a move toward selecting the right tool for a specific research question rather than relying on a single default.

Finally, while the fundamental challenges of user experience persist, the emphasis has sharpened. The 2023 report noted cybersickness as a key human factors concern, a finding this year's examination elevates by identifying it as the issue with the highest critical relevance, confirming it as a primary barrier to adoption. Concurrently, new forward-looking technologies predicted in 2023, such as AI-driven analysis, NeRFs, and Gaussian Splatting, are beginning to be adopted by graphics research communities but have not widely been adopted in research yet.

Most importantly, the current examination reveals a critical and previously under-emphasized gap in accessibility and inclusion. This emerging focus suggests the field is moving beyond questions of pure technological capability and toward the vital work of ensuring XR experiences are not only comfortable and immersive but also equitable and accessible to all users. As these systems are adopted in K-12 education, clinical rehabilitation, and workplace training, they must accommodate users with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities to prevent exclusion from these applications. Dedicated inquiry therefore becomes paramount if the community hopes to foster equitable access and prevent new digital divides. Future work should focus on designing XR experiences for diverse populations from the outset rather than retrofitting existing solutions.

## 7. Conclusion

We examined 305 Extended Reality (XR) research articles in detail, supplying a thorough, data-driven perspective of the field's current state and the questions scholars now pursue. As of mid-2025, XR work shows a lively interplay between the hunt for practical, applied solutions, especially in immersive training and healthcare, and an enduring effort to understand the human factors that shape immersive experience. These factors include presence, cognition, and sensory perception. This two-pronged agenda matters for both immediate impact and long-term scientific growth.

We found that the technological ecosystem surrounding the research rests on one unmistakable pillar: every reviewed study employed the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset. This highlights its pivotal influence on the landscape. Researchers pair the device with widely adopted Virtual Environment Systems and with leading game engines such as Unity, which supply the software backbone for XR content creation. At the same time, they increasingly rely on specialized Research Tools and Measurement Systems, evidence of a strong commitment to rigorous inquiry.

Although investigators have refined user experience, produced compelling content, and shown clear real-world utility, several obstacles remain. Cybersickness still ranks as a priority problem that demands fresh ideas to secure broad user comfort and adoption. Its high average relevance across the literature confirms the urgency of the issue. The scant volume of work devoted to accessibility and inclusion likewise emerges as a critical target for future investment. This ensures that all individuals can benefit from these transformative technologies. Meanwhile, social virtual environments with documented user bases in the millions raise questions about digital identity, virtual economy regulation, and cross-platform interoperability. Yet it poses complex research questions that interweave technical challenges (how do you maintain presence when avatars glitch?), psychological puzzles (why do some users feel more empathetic toward virtual characters than real people?), and policy dilemmas (who governs behavior in a metaverse that spans jurisdictions?). No single discipline can solve these problems alone.

Our insights act as a roadmap for the XR community. For researchers, they reveal mature avenues ready for deeper investigation alongside nascent domains ripe for pioneering study. For developers, they guide strategic decisions about hardware and software platforms while underscoring the need for user-centric design to overcome persistent challenges. For industry stakeholders, the data spotlight XR's immense potential across multiple sectors and pinpoint key opportunities for investment and innovation. As XR continues its steady march toward mainstream acceptance, a collaborative, interdisciplinary research effort that balances technological advances with human-centric concerns will unlock the technology's full, transformative potential for global society.
