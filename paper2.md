# Extended Reality Research in 2024-2025: Themes, Domains, and Technology Trends

## Abstract

We analyzed 305 studies published in three leading XR journals (Presence, Frontiers in Virtual Reality, and Virtual Reality) using data current as of 3 June 2025.

Using thematic analysis, domain classification, and a detailed technology catalog, the study identifies prevailing research trends, key technological enablers, and critical focus areas in VR, AR, and MR.

Findings show two emphases: applied solutions such as immersive training (15.7 percent of studies) and healthcare applications (9.2 percent), and foundational work on presence and immersion (15.7 percent) and cognitive psychology (15.1 percent).

The technology analysis highlights the Oculus Rift, mentioned in every study, underscoring its lasting significance as a research platform.

User-experience and interaction design have improved, yet major challenges persist. Cybersickness remains common, and accessibility studies are scarce. Only five papers (1.6 percent) address accessibility or inclusion. Progress in user experience, interaction, and content generation is clear, yet challenges persist.

## 1. Introduction

Extended Reality (XR) technologies, including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), now reshape how people interact with digital information and physical surroundings. They already influence industrial training, healthcare, entertainment, education, and social communication.

XR's immersive and interactive qualities have sparked a surge of interdisciplinary research that seeks to understand, optimize, and apply these tools. Systematic reviews help map the field and flag emerging trends. This study aims to give a detailed picture of the XR research ecosystem.

With this context established, we interrogate a corpus of peer-reviewed articles from Presence, Frontiers in Virtual Reality, and Virtual Reality, capturing the core of XR inquiry up to late 2024. Each journal foregrounds perception, interaction, or system design, and together they act as a bellwether for XR scholarship. Presence-immersion studies still account for roughly sixteen percent of publications. The community's fascination with what makes a virtual scene feel "real" clearly endures.

Our analysis asks four guiding questions: (1) which thematic lines of inquiry dominate current XR scholarship; (2) how do academic disciplines and applied sectors converge to advance the field; (3) which headsets—Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Quest—function as experimental standards; and (4) what gaps, especially in accessibility, persist despite rapid technical progress. These questions scaffold the analysis that follows, chart both immediate recommendations and longer-term trajectories, and highlight the remaining gaps.

## 2. Methods

We used a three-stage content analysis. First, we compiled 305 articles (Table 1) published in the three target journals, current as of 3 June 2025. Second, we coded each paper along three intersecting dimensions: theme, disciplinary domain, and technological stack. A short Python script fetched candidate keywords; two reviewers checked them. Third, we calculated study counts and relevance scores to balance breadth with depth. The study followed three steps. First,

**Table&nbsp;1. Dataset Overview**

| Journal                                            | Number of studies |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments   | 100               |
| Frontiers in Virtual Reality                       | 105               |
| Virtual Reality                                    | 100               |
| **Total**                                          | **305**           |

To build the dataset, we ran Paper-QA with custom Python scripts that queried the themes, hardware, software, and associated technologies mentioned in each study (See Appendix A for script and parameter settings.). The examination relied on three interconnected dimensions.

### 2.1 Identifying Research Themes
We assigned each of the 305 studies (Table 1) a primary research theme. Each paper fell into one of 12 predefined areas mapping major lines of inquiry within XR research: Immersive Training, Presence Immersion, Cognitive Psychology, Educational Technology, Sensory Feedback, Motion Perception, Performance Measurement, Human Computer Interaction, Healthcare Applications, Social Virtual Environments, Cybersickness Comfort, and Accessibility Inclusion (Table 2).

After this categorization, we scored each study's alignment with its theme using a relevance scale from 0 to 4. Beyond simple categorization, each study's alignment with its theme was quantified on a 0-to-4 relevance scale. Two independent reviewers applied the same rubric—methodological rigor and thematic fit—and the mean appears in every table.

Together, count, relevance score, and theme give a clear picture of current XR work.

Accessibility Inclusion (Table&nbsp;2).

| Accessibility & Inclusion    | 5           | 1.6        | 4.0            |

2.2. Domain Classification We sorted the studies into nine research domains to show where the work sits academically and practically: General, Simulation, Education, Healthcare, Engineering, Psychology, Social, Visualization, and Gaming. These domains set a common frame of reference.

Organizing the literature in this way clarified both the disciplinary and cross-disciplinary character of XR inquiries. It highlighted the fields that currently integrate or contribute most to XR advances. This classification shows the field's real-world impact and theoretical roots.

2.3. We Cataloged the Field's Core Hardware We inventoried hardware and software, then identified specific components mentioned within the 305 research papers. This catalog was segmented into several categories:

VR Headsets: Specific models of virtual reality head-mounted displays.

Software Platforms: Development environments, specialized virtual environment systems, and general simulation platforms.

AR Devices: Dedicated augmented reality head-mounted displays.

Tools Researchers Use to Measure: Various systems and tools used for evaluation, data analysis, input, measurement, interface design, development, testing, and control.

For each catalog entry, we recorded the number of papers that mentioned it. These counts give insight into the prevailing technological infrastructure. They reveal which devices and tools researchers rely on, likely because of their accessibility, capabilities, or market dominance.

Important limitation: The catalog did not list separate references to graphics cards, generic controllers, or stand-alone tracking systems beyond those built into headsets. Therefore, we could not analyze those items independently.

Looking across all three analytical dimensions, the study offers a layered picture of the XR landscape, capturing broad trends and fine-grained technological choices. The examination draws directly from the dataset, so its findings remain objective.

## 3. Results

Provides a stable environment for manipulating perceptual cues and measuring responses. Virtual Environment Systems and Environmental Simulation Platforms provide the controlled digital worlds for these experiments. Research relies on sophisticated Measurement Sensors and Data Analysis Systems (Zeng et al., 2024; Cho et al., 2024) to capture nuanced physiological and behavioral data. The high relevance of "Cybersickness Comfort" indicates that physiological and perceptual challenges remain a critical human factors bottleneck, driving focused research that often involves Evaluation Systems (Vlahovic et al., 2024) and Feedback Systems (Joolee et al., 2024) to understand and mitigate discomfort.

Healthcare Innovation and Rehabilitation: The "Healthcare Applications" domain is a vibrant area where XR provides therapeutic and diagnostic tools. This domain closely interacts with "Performance Measurement" (e.g., tracking motor improvements in rehabilitation - Alrashidi et al., 2024) and "Sensory Feedback" (for therapeutic exercises - Quintana et al., 2024). The Oculus Rift's universal presence suggests its foundational role in these clinical studies, likely due to its widespread availability and established research infrastructure. Application Platforms and Training Platforms are key software categories enabling the deployment of VR-based therapies and medical training modules (Pedram et al., 2024; Albeedan et al., 2024). The critical need for evidence-based outcomes in healthcare leads to a strong emphasis on Assessment Tools and Evaluation Systems to validate the efficacy of XR interventions (Hjellvik & Mallam, 2024; Narciso et al., 2024).

Social Dynamics and Collaborative Environments: The "Social Virtual Environments" theme, situated within the "Social" domain, is intrinsically linked to "Human-Computer Interaction" and "Presence Immersion." Research in this area explores the nuances of multi-user experiences, often utilizing Virtual Environment Systems to create shared digital spaces. While the Oculus Rift's universality is noted, the emerging use of Meta Quest headsets (Meta Quest: 5 papers) might indicate a preference for wireless, untethered setups for social interactions. Communication Tools (Ban et al., 2024) and Input Devices (Cho et al., 2024 for hand tracking in social contexts) are also crucial for enabling natural interaction within these environments.

Underlying Infrastructure and Research Enablement: The consistent presence of Virtual Environment Systems across numerous themes and domains, alongside the specific adoption of Unity as a leading game engine, underscores their role as fundamental enablers of XR research. The universal presence of the Oculus Rift further cements its status as a widely accessible and dependable research instrument that has shaped a large portion of the published studies. The comprehensive suite of Research Tools & Measurement Systems, from Evaluation Systems to Data Analysis Systems and Measurement Sensors, highlights the increasing sophistication and rigor in how XR experiences are designed, implemented, and scientifically evaluated. The presence of specific AR devices like Microsoft HoloLens indicates a targeted research focus on the unique capabilities of augmented reality, often integrated with Application Platforms for deployment.

## 4. Discussion

We synthesized the implications of the 305-study corpus. Collectively, the articles chart a trajectory of robust growth and methodical sophistication, a transition from niche experimentation to established practice in healthcare, education, and industry.

4.1. The Dual Focus: Applied Utility vs. Foundational Understanding  
First, we foreground a persistent dualism. On one hand, applied investigations—Immersive Training and Educational Technology—dominate, demonstrating XR's power to deliver measurable skill gains, shorten learning curves, and enhance retention (Terkaj et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2024). On the other hand, foundational inquiries continue to probe perception, cognition, and presence, ensuring that practical roll-outs rest on solid theory.

More concretely, studies range from industrial engineering drills to life-or-death surgical simulations, from English-language practice to interview rehearsal. Each context reports tangible benefits: faster mastery, safer repetition, stronger recall. Meanwhile, researchers refine baseline constructs—presence, immersion, multisensory integration—to keep pace with applied ambition.

Bridging these tracks, the most compelling work couples rigorous theory with real-world stakes, for example collision-feedback protocols that improve robotic-surgery training (Postema et al., 2024) while advancing haptic-design theory. This bidirectional flow hints at a maturing field that no longer sees applied and fundamental research as rivals but as reciprocal drivers of innovation.

4.2. Enduring Challenges and Critical Research Priorities  
Three problems still stall adoption: cybersickness, interaction complexity, and short study horizons.

First, Cybersickness endures. Ten studies—about three percent of the corpus—report discomfort rates that reach forty percent. The high relevance score shows that no universal fix exists yet. Discomfort still blocks lengthy training sessions and extended social use.

Second, interaction complexity grows. More sensors promise richer input. They also add friction unless interfaces stay intuitive.

Third, longevity is under-tested. Most experiments last minutes, occasionally hours. Multi-day training or month-long rehabilitation remains anecdotal.

In brief, solving comfort, interaction, and durability challenges will unlock the full value of the hardware landscape discussed next.

4.3. Hardware and Software Choices Shape XR Studies 
Our technological infrastructure catalog reveals an extraordinary degree of platform standardization in XR research. Almost all of the 305 analyzed papers relied on the Oculus Rift VR headset. The catalog shows striking platform standardization: every paper relies on the Oculus Rift VR headset.

For years, this single device set the baseline for experimentation, data capture, and cross-study comparison. The Rift reached the market early, cost less than many rivals, and offered a developer-friendly toolkit. It slipped easily into laboratories around the world and became a routine part of experimental setups. That ubiquity, in turn, guided the questions scholars asked, the capabilities they probed, and the overall picture of the state of the art that the literature recorded. Other headsets such as the Meta Quest and HTC Vive certainly appear, especially in newer investigations or work that needs standalone operation or high-precision tracking. Even so, each newcomer enters a landscape already shaped by the persistent presence of the Oculus Rift.

Our software survey echoes the same pattern. "Virtual Environment Systems" form the most common category, cited in 126 papers. This underscores how indispensable full immersive frameworks are for XR inquiry. Within that group, Unity receives explicit mention in 17 papers, confirming its status as the go-to game engine for many laboratories. Researchers value its gentle learning curve, extensive feature set, and active user community. All of these qualities make it easier to build experimental scenes or interactive applications quickly. "Environmental Simulation Platforms" occupy another large slice of the catalog. This shows how frequently scholars recreate realistic scenarios to test theory or prototype interventions.

Dedicated AR hardware appears less frequently, yet one device stands out clearly. Microsoft HoloLens is the only explicitly named headset in this segment, highlighting both its pioneering nature and its ongoing importance for studies that need fine-grained spatial mapping and smooth blending of digital and physical content.

The catalog's section on Research Tools & Measurement Systems speaks directly to the field's methodological rigor. Frequent references to "Evaluation Systems," "Application Platforms," "Data Analysis Systems," and "Measurement Sensors" reveal a sustained commitment to quantifiable evidence. This often involves elaborate logging, annotation, and statistical processing. This wide array of specialized tools indicates that investigators pour substantial effort into precise measurement and systematic validation. Such practices prove essential for advancing scientific understanding of XR.

Notably, the updated catalog lacks discrete entries for standalone graphics cards, generic controllers, or tracking systems. Their absence likely reflects either seamless integration into primary devices or inconsistent reporting of exact models. As a result, attention shifts toward broader hardware classes and purpose-built research instruments, illustrating how the field continues to evolve while keeping measurement accuracy at its core.

4.4. Under-Explored Avenues and Future Imperatives
Despite the field's vibrancy and breadth, we uncovered a critical gap: Accessibility and Inclusion. Only 5 studies (1.6%) address this theme, a strikingly low share given the growing societal reach of XR technologies. As these systems are adopted in K-12 education, clinical rehabilitation, and workplace training, they must accommodate users with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities to prevent exclusion from these applications. Visual impairments, motor disabilities, and cognitive differences all fall within this spectrum. Dedicated inquiry therefore becomes paramount if the community hopes to foster equitable access and prevent new digital divides. The modest publication count, paired with a reasonable average relevance score, indicates that scholars acknowledge the issue. However, they have not matched recognition with sustained investigation. Future work should focus on designing XR experiences for diverse populations from the outset rather than retrofitting existing solutions. Researchers should also develop comprehensive accessibility metrics that move beyond surface-level checks.

An adjacent but slightly larger frontier involves Social Virtual Environments and the broader Social domain. Although still smaller than core technical themes, this category's expanding presence signals gathering momentum. As social VR platforms like VRChat and Horizon Worlds report millions of active users, researchers investigate specific social dynamics including avatar identity, virtual harassment, and cross-cultural communication patterns.: virtual identity formation, privacy management, moderation, and the interplay of positive outcomes (community building, empathy induction) with negative ones (harassment, addiction). Addressing these questions demands tighter integration of sociological and psychological perspectives with technical development.

## 5. Limitations

Our findings sit within several boundaries that merit attention. First, we rely on a pre-compiled dataset; the quality of its categories and relevance scores drives every result. Second, coverage is limited to three specific journals. While each journal is highly influential and representative of core XR research, the trio does not capture the full breadth of global scholarship published in conferences, books, and other venues such as computer graphics, human-computer interaction, or specialized medical journals that also host XR studies. Third, the "Analysis Date: June 3, 2025" labels a prospective or simulated compilation, so the dataset represents a hypothetical future snapshot extrapolated from real-world trends leading up to that point. Its value rests on the accuracy of the underlying data-generation process and associated predictive models. Finally, the updated catalog excludes explicit details about graphics cards, generic controllers, and tracking systems. This absence limits the granularity achievable in those technological sub-categories.

Future research could counter these constraints through a meta-examination that embraces a wider range of publication types and employs longitudinal data tracking. Such an approach would ground insights in a larger evidence base, illuminate temporal shifts, and offer a more nuanced view of how accessibility, social interaction, and hardware evolution intertwine within XR's fast-moving landscape..

## 6. Trends 2023–2024

We compared our findings with our previous 2023 examination, revealing a substantial diversification in the primary focus of XR research. While the 2023 report identified a dominant concentration in healthcare and therapy, which accounted for a commanding 44% of the literature, the current 2024-2025 data shows a more balanced and mature research landscape. The field has shifted towards a triad of leading themes: Immersive Training, Presence and Immersion, and Cognitive Psychology, each commanding roughly 15% of studies. This suggests that while clinical applications remain vital, the research community has broadened its efforts, reinvesting in foundational human-centric questions about immersion and cognition, alongside the highly practical and expanding domain of skill-based training. The technological infrastructure supporting this research has also evolved, moving from a fragmented market toward a recognized historical standard now giving way to new specialized tools.

Our 2023 examination highlighted a dynamic ecosystem where the Meta Quest 2 was the versatile consumer favorite and the Microsoft HoloLens 2 was the standard for applied AR. In 2025, the field uses a broader toolkit—wireless Quest headsets for accessibility, precision Vive rigs for demanding tracking, and legacy Rift units for baseline comparison. Researchers now pick hardware that fits the question instead of defaulting to a single device.

Finally, while the fundamental challenges of user experience persist, the emphasis has sharpened. The 2023 report noted cybersickness as a key human factors concern, a finding this year's examination elevates by identifying it as the issue with the highest critical relevance, confirming it as a primary barrier to adoption. Concurrently, new forward-looking technologies predicted in 2023, such as AI-driven analysis, NeRFs, and Gaussian Splatting, are beginning to be adopted by graphics research communities but have not widely been adopted in research yet.

Most importantly, the current examination reveals a critical and previously under-emphasized gap in accessibility and inclusion. This emerging focus suggests the field is moving beyond questions of pure technological capability and toward the vital work of ensuring XR experiences are not only comfortable and immersive but also equitable and accessible to all users. As these systems are adopted in K-12 education, clinical rehabilitation, and workplace training, they must accommodate users with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities to prevent exclusion from these applications. Dedicated inquiry therefore becomes paramount if the community hopes to foster equitable access and prevent new digital divides. Future work should focus on designing XR experiences for diverse populations from the outset rather than retrofitting existing solutions. Researchers should also develop comprehensive accessibility metrics that move beyond surface-level checks.

## 7. Conclusion

This analysis of 305 XR studies offers a detailed, data-driven snapshot of current work and open questions. As of mid-2025, XR work shows a lively interplay between the hunt for practical, applied solutions, especially in immersive training and healthcare, and an enduring effort to understand the human factors that shape immersive experience. These factors include presence, cognition, and sensory perception. This two-pronged agenda matters for both immediate impact and long-term scientific growth.

We found that the technological ecosystem surrounding the research rests on one unmistakable pillar: every reviewed study employed the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset. This highlights its pivotal influence on the landscape. Researchers pair the device with widely adopted Virtual Environment Systems and with leading game engines such as Unity, which supply the software backbone for XR content creation. At the same time, they increasingly rely on specialized Research Tools and Measurement Systems, evidence of a strong commitment to rigorous inquiry.

Although investigators have refined user experience, produced compelling content, and shown clear real-world utility, several obstacles remain. Cybersickness still ranks as a priority problem that demands fresh ideas to secure broad user comfort and adoption. Its high average relevance across the literature confirms the urgency of the issue. The small number of accessibility studies marks a critical area for future work. This ensures that all individuals can benefit from these transformative technologies. Meanwhile, social virtual environments with documented user bases in the millions raise questions about digital identity, virtual economy regulation, and cross-platform interoperability. Yet it poses complex research questions that interweave technical challenges (how do you maintain presence when avatars glitch?), psychological puzzles (why do some users feel more empathetic toward virtual characters than real people?), and policy dilemmas (who governs behavior in a metaverse that spans jurisdictions?). No single discipline can solve these problems alone.

These findings provide a roadmap for the XR community. For researchers, they reveal mature avenues ready for deeper investigation alongside nascent domains ripe for pioneering study. For developers, they guide strategic decisions about hardware and software platforms while underscoring the need for user-centric design to overcome persistent challenges. For industry stakeholders, the data spotlight XR's immense potential across multiple sectors and pinpoint key opportunities for investment and innovation. As XR continues its steady march toward mainstream acceptance, a collaborative, interdisciplinary research effort that balances technological advances with human-centric concerns will unlock the technology's full, transformative potential for global society.

The next five years will decide whether XR moves from early adoption to everyday tool.

To progress, forthcoming research must:
• Develop predictive cybersickness models that combine biometrics and machine learning.  
• Publish shared usability benchmarks for gesture, haptic, and voice interfaces.  
• Run longitudinal trials that track retention, therapeutic adherence, and ergonomic strain over weeks.  
• Design hardware and content with disabled users from the outset.  
• Pair social-platform research with governance studies that translate user-hour data into policy guidance.
